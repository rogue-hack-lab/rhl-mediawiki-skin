rhl-mediawiki-skin
==================

Trying to figure out how to make our mediawiki install at roguehacklab.com
work as a reasonably normal/modern looking website.

To install (in a hack'ish way? what's the right thing to do?) copy everything
in ./skin into /var/lib/mediawiki/skins/

You can then try the skin out without affecting the main site by logging in
to your wiki account, going the the "Preferences" special page, and changing
the skin you want to use to "RhlSkin."

Definitely a work in progress.

Note that the font used in the background header image is from 
http://www.dafont.com/fff-tusj.font 
which says that it is a free font. If we settle on it, we should consider 
dropping a donation on the creator via that link.
